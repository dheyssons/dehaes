Everything started in 1906, when Frans De Haes took over the old wagon workshop and built an enviable reputation. His creations, from wheelbarrows to transport wagons, were synonymous with durability and precision. His secret? Dry wood and a sharp eye for perfect finishing.",
    "aboutus_paragraph2": "Frans' legacy was continued by his sons, Michiel and Jos, who expanded the business in 1946. Under Jos' leadership, the workshop evolved and adapted to new market demands. The focus shifted to residential joinery, with specializations in roofs, windows, doors and wooden structures, never losing the core of traditional craftsmanship.",
    "aboutus_paragraph3": "Growth continued with Marcel De Haes, who modernized processes and increased production capacity, moving the company from one house per month to multiple constructions per week. Innovation became an essential part of our identity, ensuring each project is executed with maximum efficiency and precision. Over time, his son, Rudy De Haes, took over and strengthened the company's position as a market leader in the sector.",
    "aboutus_paragraph4": "Today, the fourth generation keeps the pioneering spirit of the De Haes family alive. We combine tradition and technology to provide joinery solutions that span generations, always with a strong focus on quality and customer satisfaction. Every roof we build, every door we install, and every detail we refine carries over 100 years of experience and passion for the craft.",
